RTO office or the Regional Transport Office is a government body specifically
established to oversee all transport-related operations in the country. RTOs
are located throughout the country in each state and union territory. RTOs are
responsible for enforcing the rules as laid down by the Motor Vehicle Act of
1988.
The department also maintains a database of all the vehicles operating in the
country as well as issues licenses for drivers. Besides, the RTO office also
collects road taxes, supervises pollution checks, and ensures the enforcement
of all road transportation rules. If you own or drive a vehicle in India, you
will need to visit the RTO to get your vehicle registered, obtain a driver’s
license or renew your driver’s license, etc.
RTOs are also responsible for improving road and vehicle safety, especially to
avoid accidents and other road fatalities.
